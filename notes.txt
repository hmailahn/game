BUGGY CONSOLE
Sometimes when dealing with a lot of npm libraries that rely on related dependencies, 
you may receive some type of error on the command line or experience buggy behavior. 
This is usually resolved by removing both the node_modules directory and package-lock.json
file from the directory and installing the dependencies again.
